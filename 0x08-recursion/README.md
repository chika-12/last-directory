This directory contains fuctions implemented recursively
A recursive function is a function that calls itself
C accepts recursive call by a function
Recursion can be done with a loop but if we must perform 
the function recursively we need the function to call itself.
~~~
Always create an exit when using recursive function to avoid the function going into an infinite loop
the if condition is a wonderful tool for creating this restriction an avoid an infinite call
